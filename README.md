# Research-Consultancy-Portal
The aim of this project is to develop a website that will provide an interactive platform for the
Research Scholars, research Supervisors and reduce a lot of time, efforts and paperwork, and also
provide a forum for doubt solving. More specifically, to allow a user to manage and communicate
with other users. To facilitate submissions by making them online and avoiding the manual
paperwork submission. The website also contains a relational database containing a list of Research
Scholars and Research Supervisors.
